            We have our elderly regulars, they live in smaller properties where they dont have enough space for the washing machine and a tumble drier… they use the launderette as an excuse to have somebody to talk to.

            She liked to get out and have a good moan to everybody because she got sick of listening to herself.. Some of my customers got sick of hearing her… but she was absolutely lovely.

            The customers don’t like to come in when other staff are working.. A lot of customers will come in for me if they want a natter, if they just want to come in and just want to come in and get their washing done and go, then they won’t care who they come in for

            For my Syrian coworkers it’s more difficult for them to interact .. we’ve had a lot of Eastern European people coming into the town… it’s probably doubled over the past three years. I think people mind it because we’re such a quiet little town. You’ll see big groups of Romanians all talking together in their own language.
